# Measuring and Reducing Model Update Regression in Structured Prediction for NLP
This repo is for "Measuring and Reducing Model Update Regression in Structured Prediction for NLP".

Our experiments are on two typical structured prediction tasks, dependency parsing and conversational semantic parsing.

## Dependency Parsing
The `dp` folder contains the code and instructions to train different dependency parsers and get the parses from them.

## Conversational Semantic Parsing
The `top` folder contains the code and instructions to train different conversational semantic parsers and get the parses from them.

## Model Update Regression Analysis
The `main` folder contains the code to analyze parses. The jupyter notebooks there directly reproduce the numbers shown in our papers.

The readme file in each folder gives more details.
